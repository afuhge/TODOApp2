# TODOApp2
This is my second try to create a todo app. After I've started to work as a frontend developer, I learned so much cool stuff. Therefore, I've decided to start all over again and make a better version (hopefully ;) ).
This is WIP.

# Development
Start backend with `npm run exec`.
Start frontend with `npm run start`.
